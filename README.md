# Advent of Code 2023

Instead of using AoC to learn a new language, I am taking this opprotunity to learn a new tool - Neovim. I wont be using a "normal" IDE such as GoLand or VS Code.

## Add a new day

To initialize a new day, run the following `make` command.

```shell
make init DAY=1
```

## Run a day

To run a specific day, run the following `make` command.

```shell
make run DAY=1
```
